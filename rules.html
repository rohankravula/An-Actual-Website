Traveling in basketball is a violation that occurs when a player takes too many steps without dribbling or passing the ball.  It can also be called when a player takes several steps after starting to dribble. In basketball, players cannot take more than two steps with the basketball in their hands. If a player ever takes more than two steps while they have the ball, they'll be called for traveling.

                                    Fouls occur when a player makes illegal contact or performs unsportsmanlike conduct against an opposing player during a play.  Most fouls involve contact that impedes an opposing player's gameplay. 
There are different types of fouls in the NBA: personal, flagrant, and technical.  Personal fouls are physical in nature, like grabbing and pushing. Flagrant fouls involve extraordinary violent contact with an opposing player or a dangerous, non-basketball play. Technical fouls are unsportsmanlike, including screaming at the referee or an opponent. 
A referee sees a foul and makes the call.  If a player commits a foul, they get another personal foul added to their name. If they reach a certain total during the game, they will have "fouled out" and will not be allowed to play any more. It takes five fouls to foul out in college and high school, six fouls in the NBA.

In basketball, a violation is when a player breaks the rules without physical contact being involved.  Violations are typically called for minor infractions, while fouls are reserved for more serious infractions. Most violations are committed by the team with possession of the ball, when a player mishandles the ball or makes an illegal move. The typical penalty for a violation is loss of the ball to the other team, which is one type of turnover.  When a violation occurs, the game stops and a penalty is put on the team and player that committed the infraction.
